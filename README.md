# Dart UR Library

**UR Implementation in Dart -- ported from the [Python Reference Implementation](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py)**

## Introduction

URs ("Uniform Resources") are a method for encoding structured binary data for transport in URIs and QR Codes. They are described in [BCR-2020-005](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md).

There are also reference implementations in other languages:
- [Swift: URKit](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/URKit)
- [C++: foundation-ur-py](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur)

This code is a Dart port of the original Python implementation by Foundation Devices. See
[Foundation Devices Python UR Library](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py) for the original version.

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ur:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/bukata-sa/bc-ur-dart.git
      ref: main  # or use a specific tag or commit hash
```

Then run `dart pub get` or `flutter pub get` if you're using Flutter.

Alternatively, if the package is published to pub.dev, you can use:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ur: ^0.1.0
```

## Usage

1. Import the library:
    ```dart
    import 'package:ur/ur.dart';
    ```

2. Example usage:

    ```dart
    void main() {
      final ur = makeMessageUr(32767);
      const maxFragmentLen = 1000;
      const firstSeqNum = 100;
      final encoder = UREncoder(ur, maxFragmentLen, firstSeqNum);
      final decoder = URDecoder();
      
      while (true) {
        final part = encoder.nextPart();
        decoder.receivePart(part);
        if (decoder.isComplete()) {
          break;
        }
      }

      if (decoder.isSuccess()) {
        assert(decoder.result == ur);
      } else {
        print('Error: ${decoder.result}');
        assert(false);
      }
    }
    ```

## Development

To run tests:

```
dart test
```

Ensure that you add new unit tests for new or modified functionality.
